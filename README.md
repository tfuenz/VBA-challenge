**For 32-bit versions of Excel** it is necessary to run the code found in _"VBA Script File 32-bit Compatible"_. The original submission found in _"VBA Script File"_ is only a valid code submission for 64-bit versions of Excel.

The final script was executed using the button titled "Main Code 1 Final" as seen in Y2018_Screenshot.png
The contents of this button are the lines 23 through 145 in the VBA Script File.cls

**Buttonless Code**: Run lines 21 through 141 in _"VBA Script File 32-bit Compatible"_.

Lines 11 through 21 in the VBA Script File.cls represent a "reset" button made solely for aid in the creation of the main script and do not contribute to the primary assignment. 

Comments are made within the primary script to signal which lines serve to answer which parts of the assignment. They are detailed as such:
Lines 63-68 involve reading values & column creation of ticker symbols.
Lines 72-81 involve reading opening and closing price and calculating yearly change column.
Lines 83-103 involve calculating percentage change and conditional formatting for 'yearly change'/percent columns.
Lines 106-117 involve reading stock volume and calculating total stock volume.
Lines 120-142 involve calculating and displaying greatest % increase, decrease and greatest total volume.
Lines 24,144 allow the script to loop through each sheet.
